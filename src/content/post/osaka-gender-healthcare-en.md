*This article is still under construction.*

## What am I?

**Let's be honest: You are free. You can be anything. Nothing will stop you.**

If you're still wondering that  “Oh I don't know, I want to talk about it”, you are of course welcome to [contact us](https://osakalibra.github.io/contact/)!

## Why did I write this?

I am an AMAB (Assigned Male At Birth) non-binary international student in the University of Osaka. I found it challenging to find information about gender clinics and hormone therapy in Japan. However, I was eventually able to receive a diagnosis from a psychiatrist and begin HRT. I would like to provide healthcare information in Osaka for those who are looking to access gender clinics and hormone therapy.

## Abstract

In Japan, the diagnosis of gender dysphoria is conducted according to [the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of GID](https://www.jspn.or.jp/modules/advocacy/index.php?content_id=23). **(While "gender dysphoria" is already used internationally, the term "gender identity disorder" is still used in Japan.)**

In the Kansai region, there is an organization called [the Kansai GIC Network](https://www.kgn.or.jp/index.html). Membership in this organization is considered credible.

For MtF individuals, [Transfemine Science](https://transfemscience.org/) provides a wealth of useful information. I personally find this site to be a valuable resource.

**Therefore, we would like to ask AFAB (Assigned Female At Birth) to provide us with information on their experiences, as there are still very few about them.**

## Psychiatry, etc.

First, you must be diagnosed in a psychiatric gender clinic, following their guidelines.

### [Kijima Mental Clinic](http://www.kijima.or.jp/cocoro/shinryo/gender/)

- Address: 2-19-7 Habucho, Kishiwada-shi, Osaka-fu 596-0825
- Doctor: Hiroyuki ODA (Vice President of [Kansai GIC Network](https://www.kgn.or.jp/officer.html))
- Reservations: Required

The author made an appointment by phone at this clinic and received a diagnosis. The process and prices can be found on the official website. Mostly, you will be counseled by a licensed psychologist, followed by WAIS-3 (intelligence test, very long and boring, so you may need to be prepared), and then you will be examined by a designated urologist (it will be stressful, but there is nothing else you can do about it in Japan at this time). If you are already on DIYHRT, you can also have a blood test if you inform them of this. After counseling by a licensed psychologist and the intelligence test, continuing medical treatment can be provided at the Irisawa Mind & Body Clinic in Namba.

### [Iwasa Clinic (Urology)](https://www.iwasa-cl.net/)

- Address: 三共日本橋ビル 3F, 1-3-1, Nipponbashi, Chuo-ku, Osaka-shi 542-0073
- Doctor: Atsushi IWASA (External Member of the Body Treatment Judgment Council)
- Reservations: Not required

This is the urology department designated by the Kijima Mental Clinic.

### [Irisawa Mind & Body Clinic](https://www.irisawa-cl.jp/gender/)

- Address: GP・GATEビル 3F, 3-7-12, Namba, Chuo-ku, Osaka-shi 542-0076
- Doctors: Hiroyuki ODA, Satoshi IRISAWA (Regular Member of [Kansai GIC Network](https://www.kgn.or.jp/member1.html))
- Reservations: Required

Here, you will receive an explanation about hormone therapy, go through a "body treatment judgement meeting", receive an official medical certificate, and finally be able to receive HRT. (Of course, I have heard that it is possible to do HRT without a medical certificate, but I won't discuss that here.)

Also, after receiving the medical certificate, you can change the gender column on your National Health Insurance Card (国民健康保険証) to “written on the back” (裏面記載) at your municipal office.

### [Son Mental Clinic](https://son-mentalclinic.jp/index.html)

- Address: 天王寺MIOプラザ館 7F, 10-48, Hidenin-cho, Tennoji-ku, Osaka-shi 543-0055
- Doctor: Jun KOH (President of [Kansai GIC Network](https://www.kgn.or.jp/officer.html))
- Reservations: Required

This gender clinic is also well known (especially for FtM?), but there is information that it is difficult to get an appointment. The author has never been there.

## HRT

After obtaining a medical certificate, the patient can undergo HRT.

### [Fukuta Clinic](http://www.fukucli-5505.com/original4.html)

- Address:  おおきに堺筋八幡町ビル 8F, 2-14-21, Shimanouchi, Chuo-ku, Osaka-shi 542-0082
- Doctor: Ryo FUKUTA (Advisor of [Kansai GIC Network](https://www.kgn.or.jp/officer.html))
- Reservations: Not required

For AMAB, Progynon Depot 10mg (Estradiol valerate a.k.a EV) 1A can be injected at ¥770, which may be the lowest price in Kansai. The author is receiving injections @2A here once 10 days.

For AFAB, Enarmon Depot 125mg / 250mg (Testosterone Enanthate) can be injected at ¥2,750 / ¥4,450.

### [Kawabata Ladies Clinic](http://www4.plala.or.jp/kwbtlc/gender.html)

- Address: アーリーアーク 1F, 2-5-15, Juso Higashi, Yodogawa-ku, Osaka-shi 532-0023
- Doctor: Ryoichi KAWABATA (Regular Member of [Kansai GIC Network](https://www.kgn.or.jp/member1.html))

For AMAB, L'oestrogel (80g per bottle) can be purchased at ¥2,420. The author has not been there yet, but according to the information we have gathered, if you'd like to use gel, here may be the cheapest.

For AFAB, Enarmon Depot 250mg (Testosterone Enanthate) can be injected at ¥1,980. Testinon Depot 125mg / 250mg (Testosterone Enanthate as well) can be injected at ¥1,210 /  ¥1,760
